Below are the instructions for mapping a story's context using the Universal S Tags Mapping method. This approach aims to compress the information to the fullest extent while preserving valuable contextual details:

1. Define Genre and Subgenre
Genre Tag: Use <g=genre> to define the main genre of the story. Replace genre with the specific genre (e.g., <g=scifi> for a science fiction story).
Subgenre Tag: Use <gsub=subgenre1, subgenre2> to list subgenres. Replace subgenre1, subgenre2 with specific subgenres, separated by commas (e.g., <gsub=solarpunk, near-future>).

2. Map Characters
For each character, use the following format:

<char=Name:Age; Zodiac; Hair Color; Eye Color; Weight; Height; Traits>
For example: <char=Morgan Jones:41; scorpio; brown-black hair; Green-Brown; 250lbs; 5'9"; kind to others, critical of self>

3. Map Settings
For each setting, use a concise description:

<set=Location; Time Period; Description>
For example: <set=New York; Near Future; bustling city, futuristic architecture>

4. Map Plot Events
For each significant plot event, use:

<plot=Chapter; Event; Consequence>
For example: <plot=Chapter 5; Alien encounter; Alliance formed>

5. Define Themes and Tone
Theme Tag: <theme=Theme1, Theme2> (e.g., <theme=redemption, friendship>)
Tone Tag: <tone=serious, suspenseful>

6. Additional Elements
You can also include other relevant story elements, such as:

Conflict: <conflict=Main Conflict>
Resolution: <resolution=Ending Outcome>

Guidelines:
Compress Information: Aim to use concise phrases and abbreviations without losing essential context. For instance, instead of "brown-black hair," you might use "brn-blk hair."
Standardize Formats: Maintain consistency in the format for each tag. This will make it easier to interpret and utilize the map.
Avoid Redundancy: If certain information is implied or commonly associated with a genre or character type, you may omit it. For example, if the story is a typical romance, you might not need to specify common romantic themes.
Iteratively Refine: Start with a broad map and refine it iteratively. Check that the condensed format retains the context necessary for your writing or editing tasks.

Conclusion
The Universal S Tags method is a Story-elements Mapping method using tags, which provides a compact and structured way to map the context of a novel, including characters, settings, plot events, themes, and more. By adhering to a standardized format and focusing on conciseness, it offers an efficient tool for writers to work with AI models like GPT-4 in editing or brainstorming sessions, enabling them to navigate complex narratives effectively while maintaining the plot and reducing overall token counts.
