# Universal Story Tags (U-STags)

## Description
Universal Story Tags (U-STags) is an open-source project dedicated to creating a set of Natural Language Processing (NLP) instructions that provide a framework for condensing larger stories into smaller token counts without losing relevant details. It achieves this by associating stories with corresponding tags for efficient classification, retrieval, and organization. The detailed mapping of stories to tags can be found in `storyTagMapping.md`.

This project has been designed with scalability and community contribution in mind. It can be expanded to include additional functionalities as discovered and used by the community.

## Story Tag Mapping
The `storyTagMapping.md` file contains a robust set of instructions on how each story in our dataset is associated with specific tags. This file is key to understanding the organization and classification system used in this project and serves as a blueprint for condensing larger narratives.

## Contributing
As an open-source project, Universal Story Tags welcomes contributions from everyone. If you have a feature request, suggestion, or bug report, please open an issue on the issue tracker. If you wish to contribute your code, please fork this repository and submit a pull request.

# u-stags Inspiration
Inspired by aider's use of Universal Ctags for repo mapping, but applied instead to fiction writing to facilitate writers who frequently hit context limits and coders wanting to make AI leveraging tools for writers.

# Wishlist
Ideally this will grow as more users add it to their workflows.
1. Expanded tags options
2. Refined psuedo code instructions for different use-cases
3. Scripts in python for each of the above code instructions so this repo can be used programmatically built into it.

# Roadmap
Expanding tags and prompts to use the mapping method are next on the list.
Beyond that, remains to be seen where the fires are.
