# Story Tag Mapping for Interactive Fiction

## Overview

This document outlines the structure and usage of the XML format for story mapping in interactive games, as demonstrated in `u-stags-IF-Example.xml`.

## XML Structure for Interactive Storytelling

- **Game Elements**: Define the title, genre, settings, and characters of your game.
- **Plot Events**: Detail key events, actions, and choices within the narrative.
- **Challenges and Mechanics**: Specify challenges, mechanics, and their outcomes based on player decisions.
- **Variables and Attributes**: Use variables and attributes to influence the story's path and player interactions.

## Creating Your XML Story Map

1. **Outline the Game Story**: Develop the plot's Decision Points, characters, and settings of your game.
2. **Translate into XML**: Structure these elements into XML, ensuring clarity and coherence in the narrative flow.
3. **Incorporate Dynamics**: Integrate challenges and mechanics that respond to player choices.

Refer to `stm-IF-Example.xml` in the project repository for a detailed example of an XML story map.
